Experiment-Before-Build
=======================
Opportunities to experiment before investing heavily in a software build
There are many opportunities under a lean startup construction for software developers to ensure that building software is worthwhile. In this manner, time and money can be saved. Before experimentation, developers can engage in analytics, interviews, and proxies. Afterwards, there are several "experiments" that can be performed. They are highlighted below: 
Landing Page - validates interest only
Email - validates interest only
Video (viral marketing) 
"Wizard of Oz" (work behind the scenes for only a few users and learn)
Hustle (initially selling idea versus viable product; build after cash received)
Concierge (high touch at first with customers and automate in future)
All of these experiments are designed to mitigate risk and improve the probability of success. It is also the goal to reduce "dark matter", which is effectively anything not specified when developing the software or app. These can be finer details like the shape or color of a button, but it can also be something more serious like the structure and flow of a website or the viabilty of a business.
